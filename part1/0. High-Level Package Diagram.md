# High-Level Package Diagram

## Explanatory Notes

### **Presentation Layer**
Handles all user interactions through services and API endpoints.  
It provides a simplified interface for external communication.

### **Business Logic Layer**
Contains the core logic and models (`User`, `Place`, `Review`, `Amenity`).  
It enforces business rules and orchestrates operations between layers.

### **Persistence Layer**
Manages data storage and retrieval.  
It interacts directly with the database through Data Access Objects (DAOs).

### **Facade Pattern**
The `Presentation Layer` communicates with the `Business Logic Layer` via a **facade**,  
providing a unified and simplified interface.  
This pattern decouples external services from internal complexity,  
promoting **modularity** and **maintainability**.
