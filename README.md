# HBnB Project

This repository contains the HBnB project, developed in four progressive parts, each building upon the previous to deliver a complete and robust application. The project aims to design, implement, and deploy a scalable web platform with a clear architecture, a secure backend API, and a dynamic user interface.

## Project Structure

- **part1/**
- **part2/**
- **part3/**
- **part4/**

Each folder corresponds to a specific phase in the project development, described below.

---

## Part 1: UML Design and Documentation

**Objectives:**

- Create a High-Level Package Diagram to outline the overall system architecture.
- Develop Detailed Class Diagrams for the Business Logic Layer to represent core entities and relationships.
- Design Sequence Diagrams to illustrate API call flows and interactions.
- Compile comprehensive documentation to support the understanding and maintainability of the system.

This initial phase focused on thorough planning and visualization to ensure a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

---

## Part 2: Business Logic and API Endpoints Implementation

**Objectives:**

- Set up the foundational project structure for scalable development.
- Implement the Business Logic Layer encapsulating core functionalities.
- Build RESTful API endpoints to expose business services.
- Test and validate the API to ensure correctness, reliability, and compliance with specifications.

This phase established the backend functionality necessary to serve client requests effectively.

---

## Part 3: Enhanced Backend with Authentication and Database Integration

**Objectives:**

- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access.
- Integrate a database system to persist data reliably.
- Develop CRUD operations with database persistence ensuring data consistency.
- Design and visualize the database schema for clarity and future enhancements.
- Enforce data validation to maintain integrity across operations.

This stage significantly strengthened the backend by adding security, persistence, and robustness.

---

## Part 4: Frontend Development and Client-Side Integration

**Objectives:**

- Develop a user-friendly interface following the provided design specifications.
- Implement client-side functionality to interact seamlessly with the backend API.
- Ensure secure and efficient data handling using modern JavaScript practices.
- Apply contemporary web development techniques to create a dynamic and responsive web application.

This final phase delivers a complete full-stack experience with a polished front-end integrated with the secure backend services.

---

## Conclusion

The HBnB project illustrates a comprehensive approach to software development, progressing from planning and design to backend implementation and frontend delivery, emphasizing best practices in architecture, security, and user experience.
